SimpleSvm
==========

Introduction
-------------

SimpleSvm is a minimalistic educational hypervisor for Windows on AMD processors.
It aims to provide small and explanatory code to use Secure Virtual Machine (SVM),
the AMD version of Intel VT-x, with Nested Page Tables (NPT) from a windows driver.

SimpleSvm is inspired by SimpleVisor, an Intel x64/EM64T VT-x specific hypervisor
for Windows, written by Alex Ionescu (@aionescu).
